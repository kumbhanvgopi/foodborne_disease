Excited to share insights from a recent project focused on combating foodborne diseases using machine learning! 🍽️🔬

🔍 **Project Overview**: Foodborne illnesses affect millions in the US yearly, with some outbreaks posing severe threats. Our goal was to predict factors contributing to these outbreaks, aiding the CDC in proactive measures.

📊 **Key Features**: Leveraging supervised learning, we analyzed state, month, year, food consumed, and location to predict illness counts. This assists in outbreak prediction and classification of diseases based on scale.

⚙️ **Algorithms Used**: We employed a range of algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, logistic regression for classification, and various time series analysis models.

🧹 **Data Cleaning and Normalization**: Addressing messy data via pandas ensured minimal loss and uniform distribution for optimal predictions. Operations included handling null values, feature selection, and normalization.

📈 **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas aided in visually representing findings, enhancing stakeholder understanding.

🛠️ **Techniques Applied**: String indexing, one-hot encoding, and evaluation metrics like RMSE for regression and AUC ROC for classification were utilized.

🔗 **Dataset**: Utilized the Foodborne Disease Outbreaks dataset (1998-2015) from CDC and FDA, available on Kaggle. [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/foodborne-diseases)

This project not only sheds light on crucial insights but also empowers stakeholders to take proactive measures against foodborne diseases. Let's work together towards a healthier future! 💪🌱 #FoodSafety
